JTables (Java Tables) is a small library that helps you generate tablular output in various predefined formats.

## Example Code

```java


```

## Picking the right table format

Tables are nice, but each table has their positive and negative things.

The [documentation](docs/tables) explains the cons and pros of each table.

## Including in your project

<dependency>

    <artifactId>jtables</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'org.netirc.library:jtables:1.0'
```
