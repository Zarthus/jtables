## Issues

Is JTables not working as you'd like? Do you have a great suggestion? Let us know!

- Feature Suggestions: Make a new issue explaining your idea. A good title
  and a few use-cases go a long way.
- Bug reports: Make a new issue explaining the issue to the best of your abilities.
  Some information to include: What the bug is, the reproduction steps,
  and what command(s) you've used to encounter the bug.

Security issues should not be reported publically. If you think you have found a
security issue, refer to the README for instructions on how to report those.

Please search for issues existing already that cover your suggestion/bug.

## Pull Requests

When making changes, there are a few key considerations to make (depending on
the scale of your change, some may be less relevant than others)

- Documentation
  - JavaDocs should be included for new methods
  - A new Markdown file should be created in `docs` if your feature is significant in size
    and requires extra elaboration, or introduces a new table.
- Tests
  - Ensure existing tests still work prior to submitting your pull request.
- Describe what your change does in the pull request
  - Relatively straightforward, but please write a small description of what you changed, and why
    you think this is a good change. You may also reference the issue you've fixed in here.
